Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\nC. The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\nD. If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.Answer:"}], "answer": "D", "label": "D"}, {"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.
